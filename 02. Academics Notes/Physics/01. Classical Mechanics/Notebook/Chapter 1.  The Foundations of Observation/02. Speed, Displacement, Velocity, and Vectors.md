# Developing Tools of Measurement

In our universe, events occur all the time. Volcanoes erupt, stars explode, and rocks roll down hills. We know that these events don't have to happen in the same place or at the same time.

Let's imagine we see a big rock at the top of a hill. Something primal inside us wants to push the rock down the hill.

Before we do, we recollect our previous findings on  [[01. Space, Position, Time, and the need for Measurements|space, position, and time]] from earlier. We realize rolling this rock down the hill is a great opportunity to better understand these ideas. But we need a well thought out plan to learn anything useful.

We know if we roll the rock, it will move to a new place over time. But how do we describe this precisely? We remember there's no standard way to measure in the world, so we have to develop our own tools of quantification.

Thinking quickly, we find a straight stick on the ground. We decide that this stick will be our way to measure distance (our contrived base unit of length measurement much like the metric meter).  

But what about time? We don't have clocks or watches. We need something that happens regularly and consistently. We notice a leaf dripping water steadily after a recent rain. This dripping will be our way to measure time for now (our contrived base unit of time much like the second).

# Speed / Average Velocity

With a stick for distance and the dripping leaf for time, we push the rock down the hill. It seems to pick up speed as it rolls, but we're just focusing on measuring distance and time for now.

The rock stops after 25 drips. We log this.

Next, we use our stick to measure from where the rock started to where it stopped. It has traveled 100 stick lengths.

So, the rock went 100 stick lengths in 25 drips.

Unsure what to do next, we try again with a smaller rock.

This time, the smaller rock travels 120 stick lengths in 20 drips.

We intuitively know that the smaller boulder has gone farther in less time, but how do we compare and describe these results precisely? 

We decide to look at the distance and time for each boulder separately.

Focusing on the first boulder, which rolled 100 stick lengths in 25 drips, we wonder how far it rolled per drip (effectively re-standardizing our data back to our base unit of time). We're asking, "For each drip, how many stick lengths did it cover?" (stick-lengths/drips) We could also ask, "For each stick length, how many drips occurred?" (drips/stick-lengths) but we will stick with the former.

The mathematical tool of <span style="font-weight:bold; color: var(--text-normal)">division</span> (assuming that it has already been discovered) <mark class="custom-highlight">provides an easy way to find the ratios and proportionment between two things</mark>. For x/y we are asking, "for each y, how many x?" or "how many x for each y?" so this will naturally help us compare our measurements. 

It then feels natural to us to divide the total distance by the total time to understand the distance traveled per unit of time more clearly. This ratio tells us that for every 25 drips, the boulder travels 100 stick lengths. By simplifying the coefficients in this ratio, we obtain a more fundamental description of our movement: the number of stick lengths moved per drip. So, after simplification, $\frac{100 \text{ stick lengths}}{25 \text{ drips}}=\text{4 stick lengths per drip}$ . This means that for each drip, the boulder rolls 4 stick lengths.

Applying this to the second boulder, we find it moves $\text{6 stick lengths per drip}$.

So, the second boulder rolls 2 more stick lengths per drip than the first one.

<mark class="custom-highlight">This reveals a connection between measurements. Knowing the rate of roll and the total roll time, we can figure out the distance. Or, knowing the distance and rate, we can find the total time elapsed.</mark>

For example, the first boulder rolled at a rate of $4 \text{ stick lengths per drip}$ for $25 \text{ drips}$. We roll 4 stick lengths each drip, so if it rolled for 2 drips, it would travel 8 stick lengths, if it rolled for 3 drips it would travel 12 stick lengths, etc etc. Since we know it rolled for 25 drips, multiplying the duration by the rate gives us the total distance, $\frac{4\text{ stick lengths}}{1\,\text{drips}} \times 25 \text{ drips} = 100 \text{ stick lengths}$.

We generalize our findings and declare that the <mark class="custom-highlight"><span style="font-weight:bold; color: var(--text-normal)">average rate of change</span> for any object can be expressed as</mark> $r=\frac{x}{t}$ <mark class="custom-highlight">where x = change in position and t = time.</mark> (This is the average rate of change as we are not yet accounting for acceleration.) ^1b4387

We have uncovered a profound relationship between distance and time, critical for understanding more complex aspects of our universe.

We're on the brink of discovering acceleration and velocity!

# Vectors, Scalars, Distance and Displacement

Refresher on elementary vectors and scalars:

In a subsequent rock rolling experiment, our rock rolled 117 stick lengths, came to a stop, then rolled back two stick lengths.

Should we measure how many stick lengths it rolled in total or how many stick lengths it traveled from its initial position?

After some pondering, we come to the conclusion that both may be useful in different scenarios so we should record both.

We will call the total stick lengths traveled <span style="font-weight:bold; color: var(--text-normal)">"distance"</span>, and the distance from the initial position as <span style="font-weight:bold; color: var(--text-normal)">"displacement."</span>  Their formal definitions are as follows:

>[!div]
>
><mark class="custom-highlight"><span style="font-weight:bold; color: var(--text-normal)">Distance</span> is defined as the total length traveled by an object, irrespective of its direction.</mark> It's a scalar quantity, expressing solely the magnitude of the movement.
>
>
><mark class="custom-highlight"><span style="font-weight:bold; color: var(--text-normal)">Displacement</span> represents the object's overall change in position.</mark> It's a vector quantity, meaning it accounts for both the magnitude and the direction of the movements from the initial to the final position.

<span style="color:#ffffff">Example</span>:

A car is traveling at 25m/s down a freeway.  There is some wet paint on one of the wheels, so every time the wheel goes around, it leaves a dot.  The wheel goes around once every 0.079s.  Find the distance between the dots, and interpret what this distance means, ie. where could it be measured on the car?

x-x-x-x-x-x

To find the distance between the dots left by a point on one of the car's wheels, we need to understand the relationship between the speed of the car and the rotational speed of the wheels.

1.**Speed of the Car:** The car is traveling at $25, \text{m/s}$. This is the linear speed of the car, meaning this is how fast the car is moving forward.
    
2.**Rotational Speed of the Wheel:** The wheel completes one rotation in $0.079 \, \text{s}$. This gives us the wheel's rotational speed, but to connect this rotational speed to the linear speed of the car, we need to consider the distance covered by a point on the circumference of the wheel in one rotation.
    
3.**Connecting Linear and Rotational Speeds:** The distance between two consecutive dots is essentially the distance a point on the circumference of the wheel covers in one rotation. Since the wheel's rotation is linked to the car's linear movement, we can infer that in $0.079, \text{s}$, the car travels a distance equal to the circumference of the wheel (which is the distance between two dots).
    
4.**Equation Rationalization:** By setting up the equation $25, \text{m/s} = \frac{x}{0.079, \text{s}}$,<mark class="custom-highlight"> we're saying that the distance x covered by the car in 0.079 s (which is the same as the distance between two dots) is equal to the speed of the car </mark>($25, \text{m/s}$) times $0.079, \text{s}$. This equation allows us to calculate $x$, the distance between the dots, by understanding that the linear speed of the car over the time it takes for one wheel rotation gives us the length of the path covered by a point on the wheel's circumference. 

The distance between the dots left by a point on one of the car's wheels then is $1.975$ meters.


<span style="font-style; color:#ffffff">Practice Problems:</span>

1. **Comparative Analysis of Movement:** After observing the first two rocks roll down the hill, you find a third rock that seems about the same size as the first one. Wanting to see if weight distribution affects the distance traveled, you roll this third rock down the hill and it travels 110 stick lengths in 27 drips. Compare the rate of travel (stick lengths per drip) of this third rock to the first and second rocks. How does the rate of this rock compare to the others, and what might your observations suggest about the relationship between a rock's characteristics and how it rolls?


2. **Predictive Planning:** Inspired by your experiments, you decide to test another variable: the angle of the hill. You find a hill that's steeper than the first. Before rolling a rock down this new hill, predict whether you think the rock will cover more, less, or the same distance in the same number of drips as your previous experiments. Explain your reasoning based on what you've learned about distance, time, and rate of travel from your earlier trials. After making your prediction, roll a rock down the hill to travel for a fixed amount of drips, say 25, and measure the distance it covers. How does the actual outcome compare to your prediction?
   
   (Gets you to start pondering gravitation)


3. **Introduction to Standardizing Measurements:** Considering that your stick and dripping leaf are your units of measurement, discuss how you might standardize these measurements to share your findings with others or to compare with future experiments. For example, if another person uses a different stick or finds a leaf that drips at a different rate, how could you ensure that your measurements are comparable? Propose a method for standardizing the length of the stick and the interval between drips, drawing parallels to how modern units of measurement might have been standardized from arbitrary beginnings.  
   
   (This is where unit conversions come in handy)
