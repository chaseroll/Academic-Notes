BOOM! We just popped into existence in the universe before any life ever existed. We are not in our corporal form, however. We can observe anything and everything, interact with nature in a physical way, and experience physical phenomena. Additionally, whoever put us here equipped us with an understanding of a myriad of mathematical tools including algebra, trigonometry, and some rudimentary calculus but left us without any knowledge of how to apply it meaningfully to the universe around us. We are faced with the monumental task of rediscovering physics from scratch.

We begin by pondering fundamental and philosophical questions about our existence:

---
# Position

First off, where are we? We see planets, stars, asteroids, and various other objects. Clearly, I exist, and so do these objects I observe, but where exactly is "here"?

We're in the universe, of course, but what exactly describes the universe?

This thought proves elusive, so for now, we define the <mark class="custom-highlight"><span style="color: var(--text-normal)">universe</span> simply as the place where things exist.</mark>

Observing our surroundings, it's evident not everything occupies the same space. Some objects are near, while others are distant.

We term this concept position and define it as follows:

>[!div]
><mark class="custom-highlight"><span style="color: var(--text-normal)">Position</span> is a distinct point of existence within the universe.</mark>

I occupy one position, while that comet over there occupies another.

Fantastic! We're starting to get the hang of things.

# Time

Next, we notice that some events occur now while others take place later.

Now... later... What do these concepts truly mean?

Just as objects exist in different spaces, events unfold at different moments.

We call this phenomenon time.

But how do we define time? After some thought, we arrive at a definition:

>[!div]
><mark class="custom-highlight"><span style="color: var(--text-normal)">Time</span> is the duration between any conceivable events.</mark>

This raises a question: if no events occur, does time exist?

Imagine a baseball hurtling through space at 10,000,000 mph. One moment it passes an asteroid, the next a planet. We understand intuitively that these events don't happen simultaneously or in the same location.

The planet and asteroid lend our velocity meaning. Without them, we lack reference points.

Picture the baseball in space again, this time as the sole object in existence. Is it moving? 

Without anything to compare its motion to, can we say time is passing if no observable events occur?

These are big questions we're not yet equipped to answer.

# Measurements 

We also come to realize that there seems to be no inherent method to track or quantify changes in the properties we have discovered.

If I move, how do I measure how much my position changes or how much time elapsed while it was changing?

After deep thought, we catch on to the fact that <mark class="custom-highlight">we must devise our own system of <span style="color: var(--text-normal)">measurements</span>, as the universe offers no objective standard.</mark>

We're free to assign any standardized system of values we like to position or time, and that's exactly what we'll do next.
