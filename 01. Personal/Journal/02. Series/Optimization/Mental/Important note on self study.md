1. For an effective self-study and notes setup, follow this structure:

  

`Subject > Sources > Curriculum > Documents/Problems > {Added Comments/Summary}`

  

Using **Obsidian.md** for efficient and impactful note management inspired by the Feynman Technique. Here's how it works:

  

- **Select a Subject**: <span style="color:gray">Pick an interest area, e.g., physics.</span>

- **Identify Anchor Sources**: <span style="color:gray">Find three or more core sources, including at least one textbook, like online libraries or lecture series.</span>

- **Draft a Syllabus**: <span style="color:gray">If needed, create a topic outline in Obsidian, arranging from basic to complex following inductive chain learning principles.</span>

- **Gather and Organize Documents**: <span style="color:gray">For each topic, collect relevant documents from your sources and organize them in Obsidian. Create a High Level Summary or introduction for the topics in referenced documents.</span>

- **Enhance Your Notes**: <span style="color:gray">Add supplementary content, practice resources, and explain topic context and interconnections in Obsidian.</span>

  

**Additional optimizations**:

  

- **Tagging and Cross-Referencing**: <span style="color:gray">Use tags for categorization and easy content retrieval, indicating topic prerequisites and dependencies.</span>

- **Version Control**: <span style="color:gray">Utilize tools like GitHub to track note changes over time.</span>

- **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**: <span style="color:gray">Implement tools like Anki for memorization and review, linking your SRS deck to relevant Obsidian notes.</span>

- **Robust Problem-Solving Framework and Notation**: <span style="color:gray">If needed, develop a fundamental framework or notation using techniques like First Principles for understanding and heuristic methods for tackling complex analytical and philosophical problems.</span>

- **Systematic Review and Modification**: <span style="color:gray">Regularly review and update your learning path and materials based on assessments and new findings.</span>

  

<span style="color:gray">This structured approach helps efficiently build a curriculum, organize coursework, enrich documents, and foster interconnected learning through inductive chain learning.</span>

2. To orchestrate a harmonious daily framework, adhere to these principles:

  

`Wake > Mindfulness > Physical Activity > Nutrition > Habit Management > Organization > Hobbies > Reading > Sleep`

  

Incorporate **Journal Apps**, **Organizational Tools**, and **Time-Blocking Techniques** inspired by renowned methodologies such as the Eisenhower Box for prioritization, Kanban for workflow management, and the Pomodoro Technique for time management, to foster reflective habit tracking, efficient management, and effective time allocation. Here's how it unfolds:

  

- **Wake**: <span style="color:gray">Maintain a consistent wake-up and sleep schedule to regulate your circadian rhythm and ensure restorative rest.</span>

- **Mindfulness Practice**: <span style="color:gray">Throughout the day, engage in meditation, prayer, and journaling daily to cultivate emotional equilibrium, self-awareness, and mental acuity.</span>

- **Physical Activity**: <span style="color:gray">Exercise daily to enhance cardiovascular health, mood regulation, and cognitive performance.</span>

- **Nutrition**: <span style="color:gray">Adopt a clean eating regimen for every meal to nourish the body and sustain metabolic functions.</span>

- **Habit Management**: <span style="color:gray">Identify, delineate, and mitigate detrimental habits, fostering beneficial behaviors to support personal and professional growth.</span>

- **Organization**: <span style="color:gray">Maintain an orderly environment and employ Benjamin Franklin's time-blocking technique via tools like Google Calendar to allocate specific time slots for various activities, ensuring a structured and balanced schedule.</span>

- **Hobbies**: <span style="color:gray">Engage in hobbies that invigorate creativity, elicit joy, and contribute to holistic well-being.</span>

- **Reading**: <span style="color:gray">Engage in nightly reading to foster intellectual growth, enhance knowledge retention, and cultivate a lifelong learning ethos.</span>

- **Sleep**: <span style="color:gray">Adhere to a consistent sleep schedule and create a conducive sleep environment to promote restorative sleep and optimize circadian rhythm.</span>

  

**Additional optimizations**:

  

- **Habit Tracking and Analysis**: <span style="color:gray">Utilize habit tracking tools to monitor habit progression, discern patterns, and make evidence-based adjustments to your routine.</span>

- **Social Interaction**: <span style="color:gray">Engage in meaningful social interactions to enrich emotional well-being, broaden perspectives, and foster social coherence.</span>

- **Walking**: <span style="color:gray">Incorporate daily walks to foster mental clarity, enjoy the therapeutic effects of nature, and enhance physical wellness.</span>

- **Continuous Reflection and Adaptation**: <span style="color:gray">Regularly reflect on personal experiences, assess progress, and adapt your daily framework based on accrued insights and personal growth trajectories.</span>

  

<span style="color:gray">This structured approach fosters a balanced, growth-oriented lifestyle, promoting continuous self-improvement, and a proactive attitude towards personal and professional development.</span>
