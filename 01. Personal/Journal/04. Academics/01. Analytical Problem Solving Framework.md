### 1. Define the Problem Clearly

- **Express the Problem**: Clearly articulate the problem in writing, aiming for a deep understanding that may itself suggest simplifications or solutions.

### 2. Simplify and Break Down the Problem

- **Simplify**: Reduce the problem to its most basic form or use smaller numbers to make it more accessible.
- **Decompose**: Segment the problem into smaller, manageable components that can be individually solved and then integrated.

### 3. Relate to Past Experiences and Knowledge

- **Reflect on Successes**: Leverage analogous thinking to apply strategies from past successes to the current problem.
- **Use Known Methods**: Connect the problem to established methods or theories that provide a starting point for generating solutions.

### 4. Analyze All Angles

- **Unused Elements**: Identify any aspects of the problem not yet exploited for potential breakthroughs.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Begin with the end in mind, determining necessary steps by working backwards from the desired outcome.

### 5. Reflect and Persist

- **Evaluate and Learn**: Reflect on the solution process, understanding what was effective or where gaps remained. If a solution wasn't found, use this as a learning opportunity to deepen your understanding.
- **Maintain a Problem Inventory**: Keep unresolved problems in mind, revisiting them with new insights or knowledge gained over time.
