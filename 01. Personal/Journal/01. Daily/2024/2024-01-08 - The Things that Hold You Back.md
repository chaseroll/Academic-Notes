This is already very well intuitively understood by me but I would like to cement it with words.

In my life the strongest impeding forces have been:


01. <span style="color:#ffffff">Inadequate Sleep</span>
    Your success in life revolves almost entirely around getting a good nights sleep. IT IS LITERALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT IN YOUR LIFE. Yet, despite this, you repeatedly fail to maintain a consistent sleep schedule wether by negligence or simply a lack of discipline. If you truly wish to make something of your life, you absolutely must conquer your sleep schedule.

02. <span style="color:#ffffff">Headless entertainment</span>
    This one is tricky because it primarily exists on one of the most powerful, yet difficult to properly use, tools I have at my disposal creating a double edged sword. There are quite a few positive elements of social media: educational material, motivational videos, etc but most of it exists simply as vapid entertainment. For educational topics, you will learn much faster if you actually read and you seem to have already armed yourself with all of the mental frameworks that you need to succeed in this world. We find ourselves at a precipice. We must cease from wasting our time indulging heedlessly in what was once a valuable asset to us and choose to spread our wings to fly. Ditch social media of all forms, it no longer benefits you.

03. <span style="color:#ffffff">Physical Training</span>
    Apart from being a crucial component of building your image, I find what sets me up best for a productive day are getting a full night sleep and then having a strong workout with ice bath & sauna in the morning. It is a very peaceful time and gives me motivation to crush the rest of my day.

04. <span style="color:#ffffff">Inadequate Diet, Hydration</span>
    These are elements that can quite drastically impact your perception of the world, ability in the gym, cognitive performance, motivation, etc. Needless to say, proper diet and hydration is absolutely paramount to continue performing in all areas of life at a high level

05. <span style="color:#ffffff">Lack of Meditation and the Development of Insecurity</span>
    Often times, you allow your day to become so packed that you find that you have had no time to truly think. Having time to reflect and uncover the basis of your beliefs is critical for developing effective communication skills. When you fail to do this you often are unable to clearly articulate ideas or simply lack the understanding to speak on many topics. This inevitably fosters insecurity on grounds of a lack of self confidence as you do not actually know what you believe. If you wish to be a master of communication you must be confident which comes from understanding what you believe in and why. Meditating and journaling daily will help with this.
