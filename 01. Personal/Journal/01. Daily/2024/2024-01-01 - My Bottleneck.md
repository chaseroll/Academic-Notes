<span style="color:#767676">Everything that you have ever put a genuine effort towards you have excelled at beyond your years. This would imply that your ability to learn exceeds that of most people. This is a gift from God and one that you use the least. The bottle-neck is your own drive and willingness to devote the time necessary to building and nurturing these impactful skills. </span>

How much could you learn, how fast could you learn it, how far would you surpass your competition? </span>Additionally, you seem to possess the ability to push your thought process beyond the set or defined constraints of a particular subject. This is an invaluable skill for innovation and discovery. </span>
