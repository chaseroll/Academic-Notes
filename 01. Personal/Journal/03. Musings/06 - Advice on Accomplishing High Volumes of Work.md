I would say immersing yourself in your work is a great way to accomplish high volumes of work in a short period of time. Its akin to reading a good book where as you read you begin to loose track of time and start to see the words as images. 

After this you can implement various other tricks and get into automation but eventually will reach a point of irreducibility where you are limited by more of how fast you are able to process the information you take in.
