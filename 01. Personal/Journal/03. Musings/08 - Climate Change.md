> 01. Used as a political weapon
> 02. The immediate cure is worse than the illness (We must find alternatives) 
> 3. Over consensus??Over consensus??
> - Science thrives on debate, skepticism, and the rigorous testing of hypotheses. A near-unanimous consensus, especially on an emerging theory, might suggest a lack of diversity in thought or an insufficient exploration of alternative hypotheses.
> - High consensus levels might also reflect social dynamics within the scientific community, such as peer pressure, groupthink, or the influence of prominent figures, rather than unanimous agreement based on independent evaluation of evidence.
