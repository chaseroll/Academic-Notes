<span style="color:gray">Galileo's gaze shifts skyward as he observes stones hurled into the air, their paths a blend of horizontal and vertical motions. The complexity of these trajectories beckons for a deeper understanding. Armed with trigonometry and earlier discoveries, he dissects the motion into horizontal and vertical components, delving into the choreography of projectile motion, each step bringing clarity to the celestial dance of forces and motion.</span> 
$\newline$
- ###### #Projectile-Motion:

    - **Initial Velocity Components**:
        - Genesis:
            * <span style="color:gray">Galileo embarks on dissecting the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components to better understand the two-dimensional motion of the stone. He envisions the initial velocity vector as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, where the launch angle </span>$(\theta)$<span style="color:gray"> with respect to the horizontal axis forms the angle of this triangle. This geometric setup beckons the utility of basic trigonometry.</span>
            * <span style="color:gray">He realizes that the cosine of the angle gives the ratio of the adjacent side (horizontal component) to the hypotenuse (initial velocity), while the sine of the angle gives the ratio of the opposite side (vertical component) to the hypotenuse. This trigonometric insight paves the way to expressing the components of initial velocity in terms of </span>$(\theta)$<span style="color:gray"> and </span>$(v_i)$<span style="color:gray">.</span>
        - Formula:
            * $\quad v_{i_x} = v_i \cdot \cos(\theta)$
            * $\quad v_{i_y} = v_i \cdot \sin(\theta)$
    
    $\newline$
    
    - **Horizontal Motion**:
        - Genesis:
            * <span style="color:gray">In the horizontal realm, absent of any vertical forces, the stone's horizontal velocity remains unaltered. Galileo recalls his prior understanding of velocity as a rate of change of displacement over time. This recognition grounds his derivation of horizontal displacement.</span>
            * <span style="color:gray">He postulates that the horizontal displacement is simply the product of horizontal velocity and time, a linear relationship devoid of the complexities introduced by gravity in the vertical domain. The absence of acceleration in the horizontal direction simplifies the relationship, providing a straightforward expression for horizontal displacement.</span>
        - Formula:
            * $\quad x = v_{i_x} \cdot t$
    
    $\newline$
    
    - **Vertical Motion**:
        - Derivation:
            * <span style="color:gray">To account for gravity's pull and the initial vertical force an object may have, Galileo rearranges his equation for acceleration and adds the initial vertical velocity, venturing into the realm of vertical displacement.</span>
            * <span style="color:gray">His first step towards this goal is to think about how velocity behaves over time. He is aware that the velocity of the object is changing at a constant rate due to the constant acceleration of gravity.</span>
            * <span style="color:gray">He reckons that a good place to start would be to determine the average velocity during the object's journey. The average velocity would give a single velocity value that represents the object's motion over a time period. He knows that average velocity </span> $(v_{\text{avg}})$ <span style="color:gray"> is calculated as the sum of the initial and final velocities divided by 2, which stems from the definition of average: </span> $v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{v_i + v_f}{2}$.
            * <span style="color:gray">Next, Galileo recalls the fundamental relationship between initial velocity, acceleration, and time to express the final velocity </span> $(v_f)$ <span style="color:gray"> of the object after a time </span> $(t)$ <span style="color:gray">: </span> $v_f = v_i + a \cdot t$.
            * <span style="color:gray">Now, he wants to relate this changing velocity to the vertical displacement. He realizes that the displacement over a time interval can be obtained by multiplying the average velocity by the time interval. This idea comes from the definition of velocity as displacement over time: </span> $y = v_{\text{avg}} \cdot t = \left( \frac{v_i + v_f}{2} \right) \cdot t$.
            * <span style="color:gray">He decides to substitute the expression for </span> $(v_f)$ <span style="color:gray"> from the equation of motion into the formula for </span> $(y)$ <span style="color:gray">: </span> $y = \left( \frac{v_i + (v_i + a \cdot t)}{2} \right) \cdot t$. <span style="color:gray">Simplifying this expression, he gets: </span> $y = v_i \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} a \cdot t^2$.
            * <span style="color:gray">Lastly, understanding that the acceleration due to gravity is negative and constant, </span> $(a = -g)$ <span style="color:gray">, he substitutes this into the formula: </span> $y = v_i \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g \cdot t^2$.
        - Formula:
            * $\quad y = v_{i_y} \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$
    
    $\newline$
    
    - **Flight Time**:
        - Derivation:
            * <span style="color:gray">The point at which the stone returns to earth is when its vertical displacement is zero. Galileo sets </span>$(y = 0)$<span style="color:gray"> in the vertical displacement equation: </span>$0 = v_{i_y} \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$<span style="color:gray">. This quadratic equation in</span> $( t )$ <span style="color:gray">emerges from the integration of the vertical component of velocity over time, accounting for the constant acceleration due to gravity.</span>
            * <span style="color:gray">Solving this quadratic equation gives two roots, one at</span> $( t = 0 )$ <span style="color:gray">(the launch time), and the other at the time when the stone hits the ground. The positive root is the total flight time: </span>$T = \frac{2v_{i_y}}{g}$.
        - Formula:
            * $\quad T = \frac{2v_{i_y}}{g}$
    
    $\newline$
    
    - **Maximum Height**:
        - Derivation:
            * <span style="color:gray">As the stone ascends, there's a point at which it momentarily pauses before descending. At this zenith, the vertical velocity is zero, </span>$(v_f = 0)$<span style="color:gray">. Galileo uses the equation relating velocity, acceleration, and time: </span>$0 = v_{i_y} - a \cdot t$<span style="color:gray">, to find the time at which this occurs, solving for</span> $(t)$ <span style="color:gray">gives: </span>$t = \frac{v_{i_y}}{a}$.
            * <span style="color:gray">With the time at zenith in hand, Galileo substitutes this value back into the vertical displacement equation to find the maximum height. This step aligns the time of maximum ascent with the vertical displacement, unveiling the formula for maximum height: </span>$H = v_{i_y} \cdot \left(\frac{v_{i_y}}{g}\right) - \frac{1}{2} g \left(\frac{v_{i_y}}{g}\right)^2$.
        - Formula:
            * $\quad H = v_{i_y} \cdot \left(\frac{v_{i_y}}{g}\right) - \frac{1}{2} g \left(\frac{v_{i_y}}{g}\right)^2$
      
       $\newline$
      
    - **Horizontal Reach**:
        - Derivation:
            * <span style="color:gray">In the horizontal realm untouched by gravity, Galileo postulates the horizontal reach as a product of horizontal velocity and total flight time:</span> $R = v_{i_x} \cdot T$
            * <span style="color:gray">He substitutes the known values for</span> $(v_{i_x})$ <span style="color:gray">and</span> $(T)$ <span style="color:gray"> into the new formula for horizontal reach, a step closer to unveiling the stone's earthly embrace:</span>  $R = v_i \cdot \cos(\theta) \cdot \frac{2v_i \cdot \sin(\theta)}{g}$
            * <span style="color:gray">The elegance of trigonometry whispers a simplifying truth; a trigonometric identity that relates sine and cosine holds the key to a more streamlined expression:</span> $\sin(2\theta) = 2 \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot \cos(\theta)$ 
            * <span style="color:gray"> With a stroke of algebraic grace Galileo applies this identity, unmasking a simplified expression for the horizontal reach, a harmonious blend of initial velocity, gravity, and the launch angle, crystallizing the stone's horizontal voyage:</span> $\quad R = \frac{v_i^2 \cdot \sin(2\theta)}{g}$
        - Formula:
            * $\quad R = \frac{v_i^2 \cdot \sin(2\theta)}{g}$
