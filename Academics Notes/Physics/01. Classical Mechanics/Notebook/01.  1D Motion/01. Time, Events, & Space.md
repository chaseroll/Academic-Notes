What is time?

<mark class="custom-highlight"><span style="color:#ffffff">Time</span> is the duration between any conceivable event.</mark>

This begs the question: if there are no events occurring, is there time?

Picture a baseball speeding through space at 10,000,000m/h.  One moment, you fly by an astroid, the next you pass by a planet.  We can intuitively grasp the fact that these flybys did not occur at the same time, nor at the same point in space.  The planet and the astroid give our velocity meaning.  Without them, we would have no points of reference.  
  
Imagine our baseball flying through space again, but this time, it is the only thing in existence.  Is the ball even moving?  There is nothing to compare its motion to.  Is time passing?  There are no observable events occurring.  



These are big questions that I do not yet have an answer to.

For now, let’s stick with our definition of time as the duration between two events.  On our journey to rediscover the universe, we will use this information to build more complex ideas and tools to aid us on our adventures.

There is no standard measurement of position, time, or anything else for that matter in the universe, so we must create our own.
