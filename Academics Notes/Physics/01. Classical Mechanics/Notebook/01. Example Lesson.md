# Introduction / Narrative / Lecture Video

  

>In Renaissance Florence, young <span style="font-weight:bold;" class="adaptive-text">Galileo Galilei's</span> curiosity is piqued by the motions of nature. As objects move, they sketch unseen lines through space and time, and Galileo is driven to uncover the fundamental truths behind these motions. He begins to craft the basic constructs of Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration, laying the foundation stones of classical mechanics.

# Velocity

  

![[01. Format File#Velocity#Definition]]

  

>From the definition, the derivative of the position function yields the velocity function: $$ \color{var(--text-normal)}v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t + \Delta t) - x(t)}{\Delta t} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x_2 - x_1}{\Delta t}. $$
>
>Often, the term <span class="adaptive-text" style="font-weight:bold">speed</span> is used instead of velocity. <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">The speed of an object is the norm of the velocity</mark> , i.e. it gives the **[[magnitude]]** but not the direction<mark style="background: #C1C1C15C;"> of the velocity.</mark>
>
>The speed function is therefore,
>
>$$\color{var(--text-normal)} |\vec{v}(t)| = \left| \frac{dx}{dt} \right| = \left| \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{x(t + Δt) - x(t)}{\Delta t} \right|. $$

>Since the velocity of a particle is the derivative of its position, we can go the other way around to get displacement by integrating the velocity function; that is,

>$$ \color{var(--text-normal)}\int v(t) = \int \frac{ds}{dt} = s(t) + C, $$
>$$\color{var(--text-normal)} x^2 + y^2 = r^2 $$
