Show interconnected nature like with distance formula, pythag theorem, and circle equation etc etc.


(x_2+a)^2+(y_2+b)^2=c^2? yes if you are given both the endpoints, you solve for a and b easily with midpoint than you just take one of the endpoint sets and plug it in for the x and y in circle equation to solve for r^2

1. **efinition of Perpendicular Lines:** Two lines are perpendicular if they meet at a right angle (90 degrees).
    
2. **Slope:** The slope of a line is a measure of its steepness or tilt, calculated as the ratio of the change in the y-coordinate to the change in the x-coordinate as you move along the line. Mathematically, if two points (x1,y1)(x1​,y1​) and (x2,y2)(x2​,y2​) are on the line, the slope mm is given by m=y2−y1x2−x1m=x2​−x1​y2​−y1​​
    
3. **Negative Reciprocal:** The negative reciprocal of a number is obtained by inverting the number (changing the numerator and the denominator) and changing its sign. If a line has a slope of mm, the negative reciprocal of mm is −1m−m1​.
    
4. **Geometric Interpretation:** When two lines are perpendicular, the angle between them is 90 degrees. If you have one line with slope mm, and another line with slope −1m−m1​, the tangent of the angle θθ between them is given by the formula tan⁡(θ)=m2−m11+m1m2tan(θ)=1+m1​m2​m2​−m1​​ Plugging the slopes of the two lines gives tan⁡(θ)=(−1/m)−m1+(−1/m)mtan(θ)=1+(−1/m)m(−1/m)−m​ Simplifying this expression gives tan⁡(θ)=∞tan(θ)=∞, which corresponds to an angle of θ=90°θ=90°.
    
5. **Algebraic Verification:** You can verify algebraically that the product of the slopes of perpendicular lines is −1−1. If one line has a slope of mm, and the other has a slope of −1m−m1​, their product is m⋅(−1m)=−1m⋅(−m1​)=−1.
